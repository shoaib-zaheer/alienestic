              After arriving in Belgium in 2018 as a refugee, people were introducing me to each other by the word refugee. From the first day the refugee word was positioned as a nickname beside my name like a sir name <span class="strong-text">( SHOAIB REFUGEE )</span>. At that time I thought it was a pseudonym. Once I have my proper document and address to live in one place this name will leave me alone, but when I received my document ( Papers to give me the status to live in Belgium with a proper address ), still I heard the same word (refugee). This word makes me confused, pushes me to find out what this means, what is the time duration to call someone a refugee and why we are calling each other by this word. <br><br>
              After having a proper address why am I still a refugee? Don’t I have an address, home and place to live now? Don't we use the word refugees for people/ without a home or place? For those people who travel from season to season, from one place to another place ( like a bird ) if this is not the case then we can call anyone at any time a refugee then all humans are refugees <em>( Didn't we leave our first home which was our mothers wombs )</em>. I started to make theories for myself and seek more information from those who are calling me a refugee.
              The answer which I received from different people. <span class="strong-text">"You are a displaced person, you are an emigrant, your are a migrated entity”</span>, some have answered me, it is because <span class="strong-text">you're a person in exile</span> this is why we are calling you refugee and even Some were calling me <span class="strong-text">fugitive</span>.<div class="br"></div><br>
              If there are so many words to pinpoint my existence then, <span class="strong-text">How can I be an Alien to everyone?</span> or an extraterrestrial being. Don’t we use the word an alien for being from another world? An Alien being are those we do not possess any basic knowledge about them like
              How do they eat? What do they eat? when they do eat? How do they walk? Where do they walk? With what they walk? How do they produce? Are they able to create religion? or very basic, Do they drink water?
