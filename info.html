                      <p class="infotext"> 
                        It is the 21st century and humans are still crawling the earth. They are planning to create an advanced space force, they have already conquered the blue sky and they have plunged into the Mariana trench. It is almost impossible to find a single hole, a cave on the earth that humans have not marked with their hands. <br><br>
                        Yet humans do not understand, recognize or appreciate each other. Humans are still calling each other <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>, although they roam around the same earth and share the same ancestry, they are still <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> to each other just an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. <br><br>
                        Now this word confuses me. It pushes me to communicate and to find out what this word really means. Why are we calling each other by this word? Why does this word give us the feeling we are confronting extraterrestrial beings? If inhabitants of the same house can call each other an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> then what is the time limit for calling someone an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> ? Can someone be an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> forever? If a thing in this world can be an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> forever, what will happen if our space force visits another planet someday and meets something? What word shall our space force use for that thing at that time? <br><br>
                        For example, take my story: humans refer to me with the word <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. From the first day, this <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> word was imposed on me as a nickname, next to my name like a sir name: <span class="strong-text">"SHOAIB ALIEN"</span>. At the time I thought it would be temporary, and that once I would have my proper documents, an address to live in, a permanent address of my own, this name would go away. But now that I have the papers that give me the status to live on earth. Among humans with a proper address, why am I still hearing that same word, that I am an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>? <br><br>
                        I went out to confront and communicate with humans to find an answer to the question of why I am still an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> ? Some answers which I heard from different humans were:- “You are a displaced person, you are an emigrant, you are not from the same planet”, others answered:-, “it is because you are a person in exile, you are not from this place. Your place of birth is in some far-flung galaxy but for sure not somewhere here. Looking at such a catalogue of reasons, we are bound to conclude that you are an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>, this is why you are an ephemeral entity, an extra to us”. <br><br>
                        Why? Even though I chose to stay on one planet - earth in my case -, and even though I have a proper enclosure to park my space shuttle “ with a permit ” why am I still an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>, a refugee, a migrant, or a being in exile ? Don’t I have an address, a sphere, or planet ? Don’t I have a corner on this planet that I am calling home ? Don't we use the words <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>, refugee, immigrant, and emigrant for those without a home or planet ? For those who travel from season to season, from one place to another place - like birds -? Oh please, believe me, no human is a human as the because everyone is an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. It is a good idea to call every human and anyone, any entity that shares this planet an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. <br><br>
                        I am sure you understand why ? Because all humans left their first home, the sanctuary in which humans are milled into the form of a human. Yes ! All humans left their mothers' wombs, that dark planet where the big bang theory of humanity happens. I just want to laugh here, since it is funny. I have just converted all humans into <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. <br><br>
                        For me, the word <span class="strong-text">"ALIEN"</span> and the theory around it, became a way to connect myself to my future humanity (by the grace of extraterrestrial beings or things). As an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> I would now like to share my alienistic thoughts with the realm of humans, through this project. <br><br>
