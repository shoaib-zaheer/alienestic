                    <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                      <p>It is 21 century and humans are still crawling the earth. They are planning to create an advanced spaceforce, they have already conquered the blue sky and they are the plungers of the Mariana trench. It is almost impossible to find a single hole, cave on the earth which humans have not hand printed. <br><br>
                          Yet humans are not understanding, recognizing or appreciating each other. Humans are still calling each other <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>, although roaming around the same earth and sharing the same ancestry but still they are <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> to each other just an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. <br><br>
                          Now this word is confusing me. It pushes me to communicate, to find what this word really means? Why are we calling each other by this word? Why does this word give us the feeling of confrontation with an extraterrestrial being? If inhabitants of the same house can call each other an alien then What is the time duration to call someone an alien? Can someone be an alien forever? If a thing in this world can be an alien forever, what if our spaceforce visits any other planet someday and meets something? What word shall our spaceforce use for that thing at that time? <br><br>
                          For example take my story, the humans presented me to human society by the word <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. From the first day the alien word was imposed on me as a nickname beside my name like a sir name <span class="strong-text">(SHOAIB ALIEN)</span>. At that time I thought it was a temporary pseudonym (short term nickname), and once I have my proper document, an address to live, a permanent address of my own, this name will leave me alone. But after I received my document (Papers to give me the status to live on earth with a proper address among humans), why am I still hearing the same word <span class="strong-text">(you are an ALIEN)</span>. <br><br> 
                          I went out to confront and communicate with humans to find an answer for (why I am still an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>?). A short summary of those answers which I heard from different humans. “You are a displaced person, you are an emigrant, you are not from the same planet”, some have answered me, “it is because you're a person in exile, you’re not from this place. your place of birth is in some far-flung galaxy but for sure not somewhere here. Looking at this thesaurus of reasons, we are bound to make this conclusion that you are an alien, this is why you are an ephemeral entity, or etc to us”. <br><br>
                          Why? Even though I choose to stay on one planet (earth in my case), I have a proper enclosure to park my space shuttle “with a permit”. Why am I still an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>, a refugee, a migrant, or a being in exile? Don’t I have an address, a sphere or planet? A corner in this planet that I am calling home. <br>
                          Don't we use the words <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>, refugee, immigrant, emigrant for those without a home or planet? For those who travel from season to season, from one place to another place (like birds)? If this is not the case, and <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> are only those who do not share the same planet of birth. Oh please believe me, no human is a human as everyone is an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. It is a good theory to call every human and anyone, any entity that shares this planet an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span>. <br><br>
                          You should know why? Because all humans did leave their first home, the sanctuary in which for the first time humans milled the form of a human. Yes! humans did leave their mothers' wombs, a dark planet where the big bang theory of humanity happened. I just want to laugh here as it is funny. Now I convert all humans into <span class="strong-text">ALIENS</span>.
                          For me the word <span class="strong-text">"ALIEN"</span> and the theory around this word became a way to connect myself to my future humanity (if or by the grace of extraterrestrial beings or things). Now as an <span class="strong-text">ALIEN</span> I would like to share my alienistic thoughts through this project with the realm of humans....
