                    <h3>Alienestic Thoughts</h3><br>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4><br>
                    
                    It is 21 century and <span class="strong-text">humans are still crawling the earth.</span> They are planning to create an advanced space force, they have already conquered the blue sky and they are the plungers of the Mariana trench. It is almost impossible to find a single hole, cave on the earth which humans have not hand printed. <br>
                    Yet humans are not understanding, recognizing or appreciating each other. Humans are still calling each other ALIEN, although roaming around the same earth and sharing the same ancestry but still they are ALIEN to each other just an ALIEN. <br>
                    Now this word is confusing me. It pushes me to communicate, to find what this word really means? Why are we calling each other by this word? Why does this word give us the feeling of confrontation with an extraterrestrial being? If inhabitants of the same house can call each other an alien then What is the time duration to call someone an alien? Can someone be an alien forever? If a thing in this world can be an alien forever, what if our space force visits any other planet and meets something? What word should we use for that thing then? <br>
                    For example take my story, the humans presented me to human society by the word alien. From the first day the alien word was imposed on me as a nickname beside my name like a sir name (SHOAIB ALIEN). At that time I thought it was a temporary pseudonym (short term nickname), and once I have my proper document, an address to live, a permanent address of my own, this name will leave me alone. But after I received my document (Papers to give me the status to live on earth with a proper address beside humans), why am I still hearing the same word (you are Alien). <br>
                    A short summary of those answers which I heard from different people. “You are a displaced person, you are an emigrant, you are not from the same planet”, some have answered me “it is because you're a person in exile, your not from this place your place of birth is extraterrestrial being knows where but we are shore it is not this planet and this is why your an alien, this is why you are a refugee, or etc to us”.
                    Even Though I choose to stay on one planet (earth in my case), even now I have a proper enclosure to park my space shuttle. Why am I still an alien, refugee, migrant, or in exile? Don’t I have an address, a sphere or planet? A corner in this plante that I am calling home. <br><br>
                    Don't we use the words aliens, refugees, immigrants, emigrants for those without a home or plante? For those who travel from season to season, from one place to another place (like birds)? If this is not the case, and aliens are only those who do not have home then believe me no human is a human, everyone is an alien, then we should call every human and anyone at any time an alien, then all humans are refugees. You should know why? Because all humans did leave their first home, the sanctuary where for the first time they formed the shape of a human. Everyone did leave their mothers wombs, (just want to laugh here as it is funny).
                    For me this word (Alien) and the theory around this word became a way to connect myself to my future humanity (if or by the grace of extraterrestrial beings or things). Now as an ALIEN I would like to share my alienistic thoughts throw this project with the realm of humans.
